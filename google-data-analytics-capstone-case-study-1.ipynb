The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n    \n    Characters and teams\n    Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also oering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n    Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n    Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n    Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n    \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ask-guiding\"></a>\n## Guiding questions\n\n* **What is the problem you are trying to solve?**\n\nThe main objective is to determine a way to build a profile for annual members and the best marketing strategies to turn casual bike riders into annual members.\n    \n* **How can your insights drive business decisions?**\n\nThe insights will help the marketing team to increase annual members.\n    ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T23:38:29.173599Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T23:38:29.175737Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T23:38:29.192519Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ask-key\"></a>\n## Key tasks\n\n- [x] Identify the business task\n- [x] Consider key stakeholders","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T23:44:00.68334Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T23:44:00.685499Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T23:44:00.735538Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ask-deliverable\"></a>\n## Deliverable\n\n- [x] A clear statement of the business task\n    \n    Find the keys differences between casual and members riders and how digital midia could influence them","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T23:46:04.484497Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T23:46:04.486724Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T23:46:04.609649Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"prepare\"></a>\n# Prepare\n\nThe project will use the data provided by [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/timgid/cyclistic-dataset-google-certificate-capstone).

The remaining question is: Why are there more members than casual? One plausible answer is that members have a bigger need for the bikes than casuals, as can be seen on how there are more members than casuals on cold months.\n\nBesides that, we have more bike rides on the weekends. Maybe because on those days the bikes were utilized for more recreational ways. This even more plausible when knowing that *There's a bigger volume of bikers in the afternoon*.\n\nNow for how members differs from casuals:\n* Members may have the biggest volume of data, besides on saturday. On this weekday, casuals take place as having the most data points.\n* Weekends have the biggest volume of casuals, starting on friday, a ~20% increase.\n* We have more members during the morning, mainly between 5am and 11am. And more casuals between 11pm and 4am.\n* There's a big increase of data points in the midweek between 6am to 8am for members. Then it fell a bit. Another big increase is from 5pm to 6pm.\n* During the weekend we have a bigger flow of casuals between 11am to 6pm.\n* Members have a bigger preference for classic bikes, 56% more.\n* Casuals have more riding time than members.\n* Riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends.\n* Casuals follow a more curve distribution, peaking on sundays and valleying on wednesday/thursday.\n\nWhat we can take from this information is that members have a more fixed use for bikes besides casuals. Their uses is for more routine activities, like:\n* Go to work.\n* Use it as an exercise.\n\nThis can be proven we state that *we have more members in between 6am to 8am and at 5pm to 6pm*. Also, members may have set routes when using the bikes, as proven by *riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends*.
